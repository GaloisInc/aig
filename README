A Haskell Interface for And-Inverter Graphs
-------------------------------------------

This package provides a generic interfaces for working
with And-Inverter graphs (AIGs) in Haskell.  And-Inverter graphs
are a useful format for representing combinatorial and
sequential boolean circuits in a way that is amenable to
simulation and analysis.

These interfaces allow clients to write code that can create
and use AIGs without depending on a particular AIG package.
The [abcBridge package][abcBridge] provides an instance of this API that binds
to the [ABC][ABC] library.
